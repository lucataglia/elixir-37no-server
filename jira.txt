Implement where a table ends because everybody quit or because noone wants to play again.
When a table end the TableManager {:stop, {:shutdown, {:table_manager_shutdown_game_ended, uuid}}}
so the GameManager that is monitoring him can clear the uuid from the active tables. âœ…

Check that the players that left the table aren't still recieve the messages from the TableManager.

The ref_i_am_thinking_deeply could become a map %{ref: .., count: ...} and if count is equal to 3
we can trigger an automatic choice so the game can continue. We can also think about a strategy that
reduce the time of the intervall if the timer expired X times.

Move all the files created by Persistence Actors under a db folder so I can gitignore
only the db folder.
