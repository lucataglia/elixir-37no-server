Implement where a table ends because everybody quit or because noone wants to play again.
When a table end the TableManager {:stop, {:shutdown, {:table_manager_shutdown_game_ended, uuid}}}
so the GameManager that is monitoring him can clear the uuid from the active tables.

Check that the players that left the table aren't still recieve the messages from the TableManager
